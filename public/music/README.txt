Background Music for Wedding Website

To add background music to your wedding website:

1. Place your MP3 file in this directory (/public/music/)
2. Rename your file to "wedding-background.mp3" or update the audioSrc path in the Index.tsx file
3. Make sure you have the legal rights to use the music on your website

Recommended music choices:
- Classical pieces like Canon in D, Air on the G String, or Clair de Lune
- Instrumental versions of your favorite love songs
- Original compositions made specifically for your wedding

File requirements:
- Format: MP3
- Size: Keep under 5MB for faster loading
- Length: 3-5 minutes is ideal (the player will loop the track)
- Quality: 128-192kbps is a good balance between quality and file size

Note: Many browsers block auto-playing audio until the user interacts with the page.
The player is designed to start only after user interaction to comply with these policies.
